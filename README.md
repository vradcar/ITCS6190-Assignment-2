# Assignment 2: Document Similarity using MapReduce

**Name:** Varad Paradkar

**Student ID:** 801418318

## Approach and Implementation

### Mapper Design
[Explain the logic of your Mapper class. What is its input key-value pair? What does it emit as its output key-value pair? How does it help in solving the overall problem?]

### Reducer Design
[Explain the logic of your Reducer class. What is its input key-value pair? How does it process the values for a given key? What does it emit as the final output? How do you calculate the Jaccard Similarity here?]

### Overall Data Flow
[Describe how data flows from the initial input files, through the Mapper, shuffle/sort phase, and the Reducer to produce the final output.]

---

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Maven installed for building the project
- Three input datasets: `input1.txt`, `input2.txt`, `input3.txt`

### 1. **Build the Project**

Build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean compile package -DskipTests
```

### 2. **Start the Hadoop Cluster (3 Datanodes)**

Start the full Hadoop cluster with 3 datanodes:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait for the cluster to initialize (approximately 30-60 seconds).

### 3. **Performance Testing with 3 Datanodes**

#### Upload Input Datasets to HDFS

```bash
# Upload input1.txt
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /input1
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -put /shared-folder/input1.txt /input1/

# Upload input2.txt  
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /input2
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -put /shared-folder/input2.txt /input2/

# Upload input3.txt
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /input3
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -put /shared-folder/input3.txt /input3/
```

#### Execute MapReduce Jobs with Timing

```bash
# Test Dataset 1 (1000 words) - 3 datanodes
echo "Testing input1.txt with 3 datanodes..."
time docker exec namenode hadoop jar /shared-folder/DocumentSimilarity-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar controller.DocumentSimilarityDriver /input1 /output1_3nodes

# Test Dataset 2 (3000 words) - 3 datanodes  
echo "Testing input2.txt with 3 datanodes..."
time docker exec namenode hadoop jar /shared-folder/DocumentSimilarity-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar controller.DocumentSimilarityDriver /input2 /output2_3nodes

# Test Dataset 3 (5000 words) - 3 datanodes
echo "Testing input3.txt with 3 datanodes..."
time docker exec namenode hadoop jar /shared-folder/DocumentSimilarity-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar controller.DocumentSimilarityDriver /input3 /output3_3nodes
```

#### Copy Results to Local Directory

```bash
# Copy outputs from HDFS to shared folder
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -get /output1_3nodes /shared-folder/
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -get /output2_3nodes /shared-folder/
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -get /output3_3nodes /shared-folder/
```

docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /input2
docker exec namenode hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /input3

### Key Performance Insights

#### 1. Surprising Counter-Intuitive Results
**Contrary to expectations, the 1-datanode cluster performed similarly or better:**

- **input1**: 1-datanode was 2.2% faster (22.345s vs 22.846s)
- **input2**: 1-datanode was 7.3% faster (20.112s vs 21.698s)  
- **input3**: 3-datanode was only 0.6% faster (20.773s vs 20.899s)

#### 2. Initialization Overhead Dominance
- **Job setup time**: Dominates execution (18-20 seconds per job)
- **Actual processing time**: Only 4-5 seconds for MapReduce work
- **Overhead ratio**: 80-85% of total execution time in both configurations

#### 3. Resource Efficiency Analysis
**Memory Usage:**
- **1-datanode uses 20-25% less physical memory** (435MB avg vs 494MB avg)
- **Virtual memory usage identical** across configurations
- **Memory efficiency significantly improved** with single-node

**CPU Utilization:**
- **1-datanode requires slightly more CPU time** (800-870ms vs 730-840ms)
- **CPU overhead increase**: ~6-10% for most datasets

#### 4. Small Dataset Effect
The similar performance between configurations indicates:
- **Dataset too small** to benefit from distributed processing
- **Network coordination overhead** outweighs parallel processing benefits
- **Single map/reduce task** means no intra-job parallelization

### Performance Summary

| Metric | 3-Datanode | 1-Datanode | Winner |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| Average Execution Time | 21.772s | 21.119s | **1-Datanode (3.0% faster)** |
| Memory Efficiency | 494.2 MB avg | 434.5 MB avg | **1-Datanode (12.1% less)** |
| CPU Efficiency | 786.7 ms avg | 833.3 ms avg | **3-Datanode (5.6% less)** |
| Setup Complexity | Higher | Lower | **1-Datanode** |

### Scalability Conclusions

#### When to Use Multiple Datanodes:
- **Large datasets** that can be split across multiple map tasks
- **I/O intensive operations** that benefit from parallel disk access  
- **High-volume processing** where network overhead is amortized
- **Fault tolerance requirements** for critical applications

#### When Single Datanode is Sufficient:
- **Small to medium datasets** (< 100MB typically)
- **Development and testing environments**
- **Prototyping and algorithm validation**
- **Resource-constrained environments**

#### Expected Findings
Based on MapReduce theory, we expect:
1. **3 Datanodes** should show better performance due to:
   - Parallel processing across multiple nodes
   - Distributed data storage and processing
   - Better resource utilization

2. **1 Datanode** may show:
   - Slower processing due to single point bottleneck
   - All data processing on single node
   - Potential I/O limitations

#### Resource Utilization
- **CPU Usage**: [Observe during execution]
- **Memory Usage**: [Monitor container resources]
- **Network I/O**: [Note data transfer between nodes]
- **Disk I/O**: [HDFS read/write performance]

### Detailed Performance Metrics

#### Dataset Characteristics
- **input1.txt**: 3 documents, ~1,000 words total
  - Document topics: Nature/community, Technology, Education
  - Expected similarity patterns: [Low/Medium/High overlap]

- **input2.txt**: 3 documents, ~3,000 words total  
  - Document topics: AI/ML, Climate change, Education
  - Expected similarity patterns: [Low/Medium/High overlap]

- **input3.txt**: 3 documents, ~5,000 words total
  - Document topics: Quantum computing, Biotechnology, Ocean science
  - Expected similarity patterns: [Low/Medium/High overlap]

#### MapReduce Job Analysis
For each test, the job performs:
- **Map Phase**: Process 3 documents, extract unique words
- **Shuffle Phase**: Group all documents together
- **Reduce Phase**: Compute 3 pairwise similarities (Doc1-Doc2, Doc1-Doc3, Doc2-Doc3)

### Conclusions

Based on the comprehensive performance testing conducted with multiple datasets and cluster configurations, several key conclusions emerged:

1. **Performance Impact of Cluster Size**:
   - **Counterintuitive Results**: The 1-datanode configuration performed 3.0% faster on average than the 3-datanode setup
   - **Small Dataset Effect**: For datasets under 5,000 words, the coordination overhead of multiple datanodes outweighs the parallel processing benefits
   - **Memory Efficiency**: Single datanode uses 12.1% less physical memory, demonstrating better resource utilization for small datasets

2. **Scalability with Data Size**:
   - **Execution time remains relatively stable** across different dataset sizes (20-23 seconds)
   - **Job initialization dominates runtime** (80-85% of total execution time)
   - **Actual MapReduce processing only takes 4-5 seconds**, indicating the bottleneck is in Hadoop cluster overhead rather than computational complexity

3. **MapReduce Efficiency**:
   - **Algorithm correctness verified**: All similarity calculations produce expected Jaccard coefficients
   - **Implementation is sound**: Proper text preprocessing, word extraction, and set operations
   - **Framework overhead significant**: For small datasets, traditional single-threaded processing might be more efficient

4. **Recommendations**:
   - **Use single datanode for datasets < 50MB** to minimize coordination overhead
   - **Consider 3+ datanodes for datasets > 100MB** where parallel processing benefits outweigh coordination costs
   - **For development/testing environments**, single datanode provides faster iteration cycles
   - **For production environments with large documents**, multiple datanodes become beneficial

## Challenges and Solutions

During this assignment, I encountered several significant challenges that required troubleshooting and adaptation:

### 1. **Controller/Driver Class Configuration Issues**

**Challenge**: Initially faced difficulties with the DocumentSimilarityDriver class configuration and package structure.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Package naming conflicts between classes in different directories
- Driver class not correctly referencing the mapper and reducer classes
- Compilation errors due to inconsistent package declarations
- JAR file not including the correct class paths

**Solution Implemented:**
- Restructured the project with proper package hierarchy:
  - `controller.DocumentSimilarityDriver` in `src/main/java/controller/`
  - `mapper.DocumentSimilarityMapper` in `src/main/java/mapper/`
  - `reducer.DocumentSimilarityReducer` in `src/main/java/reducer/`
- Updated the Driver class to correctly reference the packaged classes:
  ```java
  job.setMapperClass(mapper.DocumentSimilarityMapper.class);
  job.setReducerClass(reducer.DocumentSimilarityReducer.class);
  ```
- Fixed Maven compilation by ensuring all package declarations were consistent

### 2. **Original Setup Instructions Incompatibility**

**Challenge**: The initial setup instructions in the template README were outdated and didn't work with the current Docker environment.

**Problems with Original Instructions:**
- Incorrect container names (referenced `resourcemanager` instead of `namenode`)
- Wrong paths for JAR file placement and execution
- Outdated HDFS commands that didn't work with the current Hadoop version
- Missing steps for proper dataset upload and management
- No performance testing methodology provided

**Solutions Developed:**
- **Updated Container References**: Changed all commands to use correct container names (`namenode` instead of `resourcemanager`)
- **Corrected File Paths**: Updated paths to use `/shared-folder/` for JAR and dataset access
- **Modernized HDFS Commands**: Replaced outdated commands with current Hadoop 3.2.1 syntax
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Developed systematic approach for performance testing with both 3-datanode and 1-datanode configurations
- **Automated Dataset Management**: Created scripts for efficient dataset upload and output retrieval

### 3. **Output Format Standardization**

**Challenge**: Initial output format included tab separators between document pairs and similarity scores, which didn't match the expected format.

**Issue Details:**
- Hadoop's default OutputFormat adds tabs between keys and values
- Output appeared as: `"Document1, Document2\tSimilarity: 0.56"` instead of `"Document1, Document2 Similarity: 0.56"`

**Solution Applied:**
- Modified the reducer to output complete result lines as keys with null values:
  ```java
  String outLine = docIds.get(i) + ", " + docIds.get(j) + " Similarity: " + String.format("%.2f", similarity);
  context.write(new Text(outLine), null);
  ```
- This eliminated the tab separator and produced the correct format

### 4. **Docker Cluster Management**

**Challenge**: Managing Docker containers and cluster state during testing phases.

**Issues Faced:**
- Container naming conflicts when restarting clusters
- Data persistence issues between cluster configurations
- Resource cleanup problems between test runs

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Systematic container cleanup: `docker container prune -f`
- Proper cluster shutdown/startup sequence: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
- Data re-upload procedures for each configuration change
- Wait time implementation for cluster initialization

### 5. **Performance Testing Methodology**

**Challenge**: Developing a reliable and systematic approach to measure and compare performance across different cluster configurations.

**Methodology Developed:**
- Used `time` command for accurate wall-clock measurement
- Implemented sequential testing to control for variables
- Recorded detailed Hadoop job counters for granular analysis
- Created standardized dataset sizes for meaningful comparison
- Documented complete execution logs for reproducibility

### Key Learning Outcomes

1. **Package Management**: Proper Java package structure is crucial for MapReduce applications
2. **Documentation Quality**: Template instructions may require significant updates for current environments
3. **Output Formatting**: Understanding Hadoop's default output behavior is essential for correct results
4. **Performance Analysis**: Small datasets reveal overhead costs that may not be apparent with larger data
5. **System Administration**: Docker-based Hadoop clusters require careful state management

### Output Analysis

#### Consistency Verification
- **All outputs are identical between 3-datanode and 1-datanode configurations**, confirming algorithm correctness
- **Format compliance**: All outputs follow the required `"Document1, Document2 Similarity: 0.XX"` format without tab separators
- **Decimal precision**: Consistently formatted to 2 decimal places as specified

#### Similarity Pattern Analysis
- **Low similarity scores (0.10-0.14)** indicate diverse document topics with minimal word overlap
- **Expected behavior**: Different topical domains (technology, nature, education, etc.) produce low Jaccard coefficients
- **Proper algorithm function**: Jaccard similarity correctly identifies limited shared vocabulary between distinct subject areas

#### Technical Validation
- **No tab separators**: Output format correctly implements space-only separation
- **Complete pairwise coverage**: All document pairs properly computed (3 documents = 3 pairs)
- **Numerical accuracy**: Consistent calculation across different cluster configurations proves algorithmic reliability
